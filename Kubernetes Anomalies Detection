With emerging container technologies, such as **Docker**, microservices -based applications can be developed and deployed in cloud environment much agiler. The dependability of these microservices becomes a major concern of application providers. Anomalous behaviors which may lead to unexpected failures can be detected with anomaly detection techniques. In this paper, an anomaly detection system(ADS) is designed to detect and diagnose the anomalies in microservices by monitoring and analyzing real-time performance data of them.
