Anomaly detection is an important step in the management and monitoring of data centers and cloud computing platforms. The ability to detect anomalous virtual machines before real failures occur results in reduced downtime while operations engineers urgently recover malfunctioning virtual machines, efficient root cause analysis, and improved customer optics in the event said malfunction lead to an outage. With emerging container technologies, such as **Docker**, microservices -based applications can be developed and deployed in cloud environment much agiler. The dependability of these microservices becomes a major concern of application providers. Anomalous behaviors which may lead to unexpected failures can be detected with anomaly detection techniques. In this paper, an anomaly detection system(ADS) is designed to detect and diagnose the anomalies in microservices by monitoring and analyzing real-time performance data of them.
